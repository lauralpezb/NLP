    "En esta práctica vamos a aplicar algunos de los conceptos que hemos desarrollado a lo largo de las clases de este módulo. Vamos a construir un recomendador de películas basado en contenido pero que se apoye en herramientas de procesamiento de lenguaje natural para modelar ese contenido. Utilizaremos un conjunto de datos descargado de IMDB, la base de datos de películas de internet, lo preprocesaremos para extraer la información que más nos interese y llevaremos a cabo recomendaciones basadas en la misma. Posteriormente, como gran cantidad de la información de la película la tenemos en un campo de texto libre probaremos distintas aproximaciones basadas en procesamiento de lenguaje natural.\n",
